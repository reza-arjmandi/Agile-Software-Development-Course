# Session 2

In this session we are going to talk about **Test Driven Development** technique, introduce **google test**, then implement an interesting algorithm through this technique.  
I have also created a practice for you. 

## Practice

Implement an algorithm through TDD that **convert IPv4 string to decimal ip**.

example  
input: "192.168.1.2"  
output: 3232235778
